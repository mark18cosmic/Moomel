Official documentation made by Me.


## 2 October 2023

Moomel is pretty much an idea hub where users contribute and collab to implement ideas.
To begin with I will make a simple front page with no functionality.
I plan on using bulma for visual and plain html and js for this.
Later on i will use MEVN stack to add functionality and better visuals. This for now is just a simple iteration to test out visuals and brainstorm more ideas.
This will have basically 3 usertypes. Brainstormers, implementers and investors. Users wont particularly be able to pick their type but instead be classified as a moomer or something like that. Each moomer will be given access to make a post similar to reddit and other moomers can respond with ideas or help with coding questions and such. Unlike reddit this will provide a sort of faction (i havent really figuered out what itll be) similar to groups or circles where the owner of idea can select and give access to join. We can call this a barn for now. 
A barn will be like a group/circle which is an idea or a project with users producing and brainstorming ideas. It doesnt necessarily have to be for an idea it can also be a service. The idea being a private hub for companies or people to chat and conduct business. Im aware there are things for this but Moomel will be advertised for collaborative brainstorming which i guess is pretty new. Each barn will have an owner and the owner can give certain roles to other members.
Moomel will be  free for users with no popup ads (we plan to get sponsorships to fund) however we will take a small cut out of profits and provide a membership service for users who want extra features. Unlike other companies i dont plan on gatekeeping the best features for paying members but instead making it available for everyone. Monetisation isnt that important right now but i think a subscription base and sponsorships will be enough. More on the subscription later. I need to check how other websites monetise to get more ideas. 
The design should be simple and clean. Dark mode and light mode. Ill use bulma to make it pretty and i think adding a hint feature would be cool. Something like a light bulb that gives hints or ideas. The mascot/logo will obviously be a cow and im thinking of making the home button a barn. But that might confuse users so ill probably end up sticking with a cow icon. The navbar will have [home icon,  factions, notifications, user profile]. Might add a discover page to showcase some factions and their work. Like twitter ill add a feed where people can moo out some random ideas. Im not sure how this will reach users tho. Maybe a sorting system for different categories or fields where users can follow other users or tags. 
Im gonna code the mock up design tomorrow. For now ill just plan everything and make this idea better. 
Ill have to learn Vue js and how to use node for a project like this. Documentng every step seems to be helping me expressing my ideas so far. Hopefully this makes sense because im just laying down what my brain thinks. 
Moomel wont only be for tech ideas or anything just related to programming. I want it to be for musicians and other fields too. Music ideas, website ideas, and even advice for people who need it. I want to add some challenges for collaborative projects and people can compete for a certain prize. 
For Monetisation im thinking users can pay to advertise their projects on our page. Ads will be different for each user(it will match their preferences) The ads will prompt users to join the barn or promote a product. 
Authors can get plot ideas. Musicians can get lyric ideas and music ideas. Programmers can get project ideas. Artists can get art ideas. I know they can from other sources but itll be cool when they can get it all done from one spot.
To summarise ill answer some questions i found about webdev phases.
-What is the purpose of the website?
An idea hub where users can collaborate with their ideas and make that idea into reality with the help of other users.
-What type of website/app will it be â€“ informational, commercial, product, or service-based?
All of the above
-What is your target audience?
Creatives and people who are looking for that one spark of inspiration to take their idea to the next level.
-Is there adequate demand in the market?
Possibly.
I saw one question that drew my attention. What features will i implement. Im sure ive noted down some features i want to implement. Ill write all of them down once i have fully thought them out.

## 3 October 2023

Its the second day now. Ive gotten some more ideas to add. To join a barn the user can use a system similar to tinder. Instead of swiping left or right they can like the post or moo which im gonna probably call it, and itll prompt them to ask to join that barn. Similar to other social networks this will show private and public groups but unlike others we make it a bit more public in way. Its kinda hard to explain but all groups will be visible but some will have privacy settings allowing admins to choose who can join and who can view. \
Ive looked through some frameworks and i think vue will be best as its easier and more versatile(in my opinion). Ill research a bit more about serverside frameworks today. Ill begin production of the basic functions and server side things instead of the ui and ux. Ill do the beautification last however ill make a simple mockup today of how itll look like so ill know how to structure the functions and etc.
To keep everything as original as possible ill have to refrain from using too much insipiration from other websites. Right now reddit looks like what i want this website to look like but with some changes. Looking at reddit I think itll be easy to make a simple clone.
I just downloaded a vue reddit clone im just gonna look around. I want to make this from scratch so ill avoid copying code and only use this as a guide.
Im gonna start reading the vue documentation to get somewhat of an idea on how to use it before starting fully learn it. The reddit clone I found on github doesnt seem to be working. Ill just leave it. 
Bulma is being a slight pain in the ass so might stick to something like tailwind or vanilla css. This will be impossible to make with regular html,css,js so ill stick to learning vue for now. I just lost braincells tryna code a basic layout. It did help me figure out what i want it to look aesthetically. Gonna boot up figma to make the mockups. Figma didnt open (some arch errors about some missing packages) so ill use the web version.
Gonna add some visually pleasing doodles. Maybe not because ill be coding it myself. First ill do a white background possibly a light grey.#F2F2F2 looks good.
First mockup is done. It doesnt look that bad but its obviously not what im trying to make. I want to add images related to the platform so i added some place holder shapes. Ill move the searchbar down and make the Welcome part more interesting. Im gonna add boxes of content similar to github which i can easily do with bulma. Once the user signs up and logs in they will be able to use the app. Without signing in they can only see the information of the website and what we offer. After logging in theyll have a different first page with the ability post ideas and a barns page with the barns of their preference. 
Users should be able to communicate and use third-party platforms with ease. For example a coding barn can make a github to upload their code and use our platform to talk and plan things. I dont think i can implement these third-party features myself so i guess ill wait until i can get access to more programmers. I will list down some features id like but cant implement myself. 

## 4 October 2023

Alright day three. Ive gone over this idea with a couple of people and decided to put a halt. This is a really good idea but iwill not be able to implement this myself without any outside help and funding. However, i have made a logo. Learning vue has been a little challenging and itll take more time that i originally anticipated.Im not gonna let go of this idea and ill do my best to do as much as i can by myself. To list down a few things ill need they are:

- A server
- A database/included with the server
- Algorithms for specific features
- A final design
- Finalize the stack i will use
- List out the tasks i need to do (i want to use scrum)
- Join serverside and ui
- Build the platform

Just finished the first page mockup. It looks so much better than the other iterations. Next ill make an info page because users need to be able to know what this platform is about. Login and signup is done as i implemented it in the first page. Since this is a dynamic website, once youve made an account and signed in youll be greeted to a different home page. Today has been the most productive day so far. Designed two pages. Explore page and welcome page. Tomorrow i plan on finishing atleast 4 more pages and learn vue or whatever. Looking at the design makes me so proud because it proves this can be an actual thing. 

## 5 October 2023

To start the day, i made a simple sitemap. Im gonna use tailwindcss instead of bulma as its much more customisable and has better features suited for this project. Im designing the full architectural design to make everything easier to understand.
